# Hello world, I am Ignacio Serrano Rodríguez

## Backend Developer & Data Scientist

I specialize in building scalable, production-ready platforms at the intersection of Backend Development and Data Science. My work at [Woodea](https://woodea.es/) focuses on robust backend architecture and APIs, while as a volunteer Data Scientist at [VOST Euskadi](https://vosteuskadi.eus/), I develop automated emergency alert systems with real-time analytics and AI-driven automation. My expertise spans advanced data processing, MLOps, and deploying intelligent solutions for critical domains.

- Contributor to computer vision, backend API, educational AI, and data engineering projects.
- Advocate for technical excellence and best practices through documentation and deployment guides.
- Active participant in open source, edtech, and public safety technology communities.
